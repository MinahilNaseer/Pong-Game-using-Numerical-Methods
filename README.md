# Pong Game: Numerical Methods Edition

## Overview
This project is a numerical-methods-based implementation of the classic Pong game. The game mechanics and physics are simulated using numerical methods, offering a unique and educational approach to game development.

## Features
- **Physics Simulation**: The ball and paddle movements are governed by numerical methods for realistic dynamics.
- **Collision Detection**: Handles interactions between the ball, paddles, and walls using algorithmic precision.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Easily tweak game parameters like ball speed, paddle size, and difficulty.
- **Educational Value**: Showcases the practical application of numerical methods in game physics.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Dart
- **Game Engine**: Flutter with Flame
- **Numerical Methods**: Euler method, Runge-Kutta, and others for solving differential equations.

## How It Works
The game mechanics are built on the following principles:
1. **Numerical Integration**: The ball's motion is calculated using numerical methods to update its position and velocity.
2. **Collision Response**: Ball direction and velocity are recalculated upon collision, ensuring realistic rebounds.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Game state updates occur at a fixed time step for consistent gameplay.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong-numerical-methods.git
   ```

## Usage
- **Start Game**: Launch the app and press the "Start" button.
- **Control Paddles**: Use keyboard keys (for desktop) or touch gestures (for mobile).
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify configuration files to experiment with numerical methods and game dynamics.

## Configuration
Key parameters can be adjusted in the `config.dart` file:
- **Ball Speed**
- **Paddle Dimensions**
- **Time Step for Numerical Integration**
